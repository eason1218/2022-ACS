# An Analysis of 2022 ACS Data from IPUMS

## Overview

This repo aims to estimate the total number of respondents in each U.S. state using the 2022 ACS data from IPUMS. By analyzing the number of respondents with doctoral degrees and applying the ratio estimators approach, the study extrapolates total population estimates across states. The results highlight discrepancies due to variations in demographics, economic conditions, and educational distributions, emphasizing the limitations of assuming uniformity across states.
